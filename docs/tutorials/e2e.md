# End-to-End Adopter Journey

@Felix

This set of tutorials describes the end to end journey of the IT department that operates the Catena-X stack for a company.
For this initial setup, no need to connect to an external provider/OpCo is required. This tutorial can be done in isolation as it is a local deployment only.

Completing this tutorial is recommended for IT departments prior to participating in Catena-X use-cases as the IT department needs to understand the basic technical concepts and their relation before they can begin to provide or consume data within a use-case.

Anmerkung: Eigentlich ist es eine E2E Operations View Journey und keine Adopter Journey (Adopter wird bereits beim Adopter View verwendet, das ist verwirrend)

## Target Audience

This tutorial is built for employees of the **IT department who operates the IT stack of an adopter (data provider/consumer)**. It shows how to operate the various Catena-X components in combination with each other.

This tutorial is not designed for the following purposes:

- It is not designed for App Providers or Service Providers or for adopters who want to buy a business application.
- It will not show you how to further develop core Catena-X components.
- If you only intent to buy and use a business app or managed service, you won't need to complete the tutorial.

## Goal of this tutorial

This tutorial shall enable the IT department of an adopter (data provider/consumer) to operate the minimal Catena-X stack that is required to provide or consume data without business apps by understanding and implementing

1. The separate technical components
2. Interfaces between components run at the adopter
3. Connection into the wider data space

## Skills Required

No preliminary knowledge about Catena-X required.

Technical knowledge (Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, Terraform) to deploy components onto a kubernetes cluster and interacting with them is advised.

## Tutorial Description

This tutorial is split into five chapters that build on each other. It won't provide deep dives into each of the technical components that will be deployed. If you are interested in getting a deeper understanding of each of the components, there is a dedicated tutorial for each of them.

### Chapter 1: Inform

Chapter 1: Inform shall give a you a first overview over all relevant Catena-X concepts and components and how they interrelate. Starting with the onboarding guide and an architecture overview this chapter finishes with a list of documents to deep dive into the various technical components.

### Chapter 2: Connect
