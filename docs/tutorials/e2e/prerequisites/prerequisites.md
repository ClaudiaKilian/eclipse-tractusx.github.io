## Preface

The components and tools that are described here are to be understood as a proposal from Catena-X and not as standards that must be used. Using the proposed software stack of this tutorial will make it easier to complete it. Nevertheless, if your company policy requires e.g. the use of open stack, or you can't use docker containers or kubernetes, the Catena-X components will also work, you might just need a little extra effort.

You can either complete the tutorial in a cloud space (e.g. AWS or Azure) or locally. If you choose to run the tutorial locally, make sure that your machine fulfils the minimal performance requirements.

## Required Skills and Technologies

As mentioned in the introduction, no preliminary knowledge about Catena-X is required. However, to complete the tutorial you will have to work with the following tech stack. A basic understanding of those technologies is advised.

- Cloud Environment (AWS/Azure) or Local Machine with at least 16GB RAM, 20GB free storage
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- (Rancher?)
- Helm
- Terraform
