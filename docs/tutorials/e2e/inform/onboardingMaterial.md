Welcome to this first step of the tutorial. As a developer, you most likely don't want to become an expert on all legal, organizational or business related Catena-X topics.
Nevertheless, it makes sense to familiarize yourself with some of the high-level concepts of Catena-X, before you proceed with the architecture.

*Important*: To complete this tutorial you will **not** need to read through all the information provided under "further reading".

## 1. Catena-X

Catena-X is an open, secure, and standardized data ecosystem for the automotive industry. It is a collaborative initiative of automotive manufacturers, suppliers, and other stakeholders from across the value chain. Catena-X aims to enable the secure and efficient exchange of data across the entire value chain, from the development of new vehicles to the end-of-life recycling of components.

## 2. Use-Cases

Catena-X is organized around ten initial use-cases. If your company decided to become part of Catena-X, it has chosen at least one use-case it want's to benefit from. Participation in a use-case usually includes the provisioning of data according to a shared semantic and standardized technology stack that shall enable interoperability and data sovereignty.

## 3. The Data Space

To enable the use-cases, Catena-X builds a decentral data space. In a data space, data is directly exchanged between data provider and data consumer, without an intermediary. A data space requires data providers and consumers to use certain components either as managed services or as self-hosted. Furthermore, "core components" are needed within the network to ensure Identity & Trust, provide Data Discovery mechanisms or a Marketplace to find and purchase business applications that can be used to consume the data and generate value.

## 4. The Onboarding Journey

Your task to setup the technical components is part of a larger onboarding journey that also includes a registration in the network, a use-case selection, setting up a data governance structure and engagement of the various business departments. The onboarding journey varies depending on your companies decision on how to participate in which use-cases. As you've already read, in case your company only intends to buy a fully managed SAAS business application, you won't need to operate the Catena-X components yourself.
 The Catena-X association provides extensive onboarding material such as an onboarding guide or an onboarding status tracker. Both can be found on the association homepage.
