In the `Boost Chapter`, you will configure and register your components so that they are discoverable in your local data space deployment. You will then take on the role of a data provider, build your first data pipeline, add your first `assets`, `policies` and create a `contract offer`` in the EDC. As a data consumer you will discover the data that you have previously created and initiate a data transfer. After completing this step, you have all the foundational knowledge you need to get started with active participation in a use-case.
